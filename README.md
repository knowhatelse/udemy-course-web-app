# Dating app

## **Description**

This project is not my personal project that I conceived, but rather a project from Udemy that I am following and working on in order to better master and learn certain technologies that I need, as well as to learn about web development itself and generally creating applications - which means, all things, functionalities and standards an web application should contain and so on. </br>

Simply put, through this project, I worked on creating a RESTful API as well as the UI. </br>

This project is about a dating website, where anyone can create their user account, edit their profile, add pictures, view other people's profiles, and much more. </br>

## **Technologies**

- Frameworks: .NET (ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework), Angular and Bootstrap (ngx-bootstrap).
- Languages: C#, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- Database: SQLite
- Other: libraries for Angular (Toastr, Angular Materials and etc.)

## **Credits**

All credit for this project goes to [Neil Cummings](https://www.udemy.com/user/neil-cummings-2/), who actually created this project and recorded a course in which he explained everything beautifully, which you can view  [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/?couponCode=ST14MT32124). </br>

## **Status**
I've not finished watching the course on Udemy and working on this project, so there are more features and functionalities that need to be implemented here. </br>
To se the code and what's implemented, checkout the develop branch. </br>
